# TODO - Map quality

## Geometry

- try fixed pt again, for determinism purposes mostly
	- very different approaches
		- v1: keep f64 internally, but constantly drop small bits
			- we just want deterministic serialization really, so...
		- v2: try some rational number thing internally

	- retry integers for everything (probably all at once)
		- dont round too early... line intersection, dist to pt, kinematics
		- adjust epsilon values to match actual smallest difference, or start doing direct comparisons now

	- clamp distances first, not points?			This one is working well!
		- note contains_pt needs to use 2 or 3 * epsilon, because of the error that may accumulate...
		- audit all EPSILON_DIST usages
		- make natively orderable

	- change internal pt2d representation to int. JUST get that working first.
		- then get rid of approx_eq, approx_dedupe
		- make sure dist_to at the tiniest case rounds up, too. maybe that needs to happen now.
		- make Pt2D natively orderable, hashable
		- can Pt2D::new() and x() and y() return something besides f64?
	- then work on proper SI types, with negative/positive cases handled carefully
	- also bounds?
	- cant get rid of the ccw intersection check... different answer in some cases that looks bad

- underlying problems
	- bad polyline shifting remains
		- from the remaining cases, looks like we need to totally remove some tight points and retry
		- make polygons use the corrections too?

- generalized_trim_back
	- breaks down when we have jagged lane endings due to polyline shift angle correction
	- sometimes a lane polyline hits the perpendicular of a trimmed road! where was this happening?

- handle small roads again somehow?
	- VERY overeager... ate half of the map
		- can we capture snapshots of incremental changes?
			- save initial map at every step, be able to load raw + initial with a focus point
			- generic viewer should be easy... something that stores polygon and ID, wraps the quadtree, etc
		- try merging the shortest roads first
	- deal with loop roads

	- manually draw a picture of the weird intersection to see what would look reasonable. i think we need original road bands from deleted stuff to make decent polygons.

	- model U-turns

- degenerate-2's should only have one crosswalk
	- then make them thinner

- ped paths through sidewalk corners are totally broken
	- calculate the better paths first, then make the corner geometry from that?
- car turns often clip sidewalk corners now

- figure out what to do about yellow center lines
	- intersections on one-ways look weird
	- yellow and white lines intersect cars and turn icons and such
	- who should own drawing them?

## More data

- lanes: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/49d417979fec452981a068ca078e7070_3
	- not filled out for most streets
- traffic circles: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/717b10434d4945658355eba78b66971a_6
- https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sidewalks
	- disagrees with OSM road centers sometimes
- https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/curb-ramps
- high quality thick roads: https://seattlecitygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=86cb6824307c4d63b8e180ebcff58ce2
- OSM has footways
	- but theyre not marked everywhere
	- and theyre hard to associate with roads (sometimes need to infer a planter strip)
- draw ALL water and greenery areas
- draw benches, bike racks
- render trees
- look for current stop sign priorities

## Low-priority geometry issues

- if building front path intersects another building, then scrap that building.
	- or wait, just require bldgs to be even closer to sidewalk first.
	- need to do polygon vs polygon check!
	- will need to speed it up with quadtree containing entire buildings. make sure these are easy to use.

- can we make OSM buildings with holes?
	- experiment with https://docs.rs/clipping/0.1.1/clipping/gh/struct.CPolygon.html and https://github.com/21re/rust-geo-booleanop

## More problems to fix

- Disconnected map
	- Some lane-changing model needed to determine this
- Impossible turns (from a far bus lane to a crazy left)

## Release

- publish the map data
- stabilize the code except for sim
